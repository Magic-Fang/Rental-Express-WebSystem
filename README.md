# Rental-Recommendation-Web-System
A housing rental recommendation website for those who commutes daily, which can provide renting recommendations based on usersâ€™ personal references, such as basic information, safety anticipation, and transportation requirement.

To run our project locally:

(1)First, follow the README_BackEnd to run the backend server.

(2)Second, follow the README_FrontEnd to run the front end server.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure that the local host and port number of backend server is correctly added to line 25 and line 27 in app.js in FrontEnd directory. (i.e. Postname:127.0.0.1.  Port: 3000)

(3)Third, open your web browser and visit our website via the host and port number of your frontend program. (i.e. 127.0.0.1:3000)


## BackEnd

This project does contain scraping programs that do not respect some websites' /robots.txt. We are aware that this is not a good manner and we are not using and will never use those code other than studying. 

Notice: Execute the programs on large searching range or large number of searches in a short period of time CAN AND WILL RESULT IP BANNED from some websites!

Main scraping python files have their own testing code for testing/debugging (IP banned issue or other cases). To get specific run instruction, execute:

	$ python yelp_scrape_real_time.py -help
	$ python zillow_scrape_real_time.py -help
	$ python price_as_feature.py -help

To run the main flask app 'project_v2.py' on server for public IP address visiting, please uncomment the line 215 and comment line 216. 
List for flask reroutings: 
'/test':			return the testing test.json file; 

'/':				return index.html for server debugging purpose only (note that the index.html file is not included, it can be any file ONLY for debugging purpose);

'/apartmentprice'	return formatted prices for apartments on zillow;

'/filters'			return list of found apartments satisfy the given filters; 

[example: /filters?address='address'&type=h&beds=1&baths=1&pets=1&parking=1&laundry=1&price=500-1000&rate=3.5&review_count=10&places=xxx,yyy,zzz&travelling=driving&time_limit=20]


The backend files should be in below folder structure for successful running without modifying the code:

	/
	|__ connectsql.py
	|__ flaskhelper_revised.py
	|__ google_Distance.py
	|__ google_Score.py
	|__ price_as_feature.py
	|__ project_v2.py
	|__ scrape_zips.py
	|__ test.json
	|__ yelp_scrape_real_time.py
	|__ zillow_scrape_real_time.py
	|__ crime_data/
		|__ crime.db
		|__ crime_data_cleaning.py
		|__ crime_data.csv.zip
		|__ COBRA-2009-2017.csv.zip
		|__ cobra-2018.csv.zip


Before execute the backend, ensure you have installed following library in Python3: Flask, unicodecsv, requests, lxml, numpy

To execute the project's backend, first fill in your Google API key in line 5 of file google_Distance.py. Then execute:
