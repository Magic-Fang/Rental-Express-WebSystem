# Rental-Recommendation-Web-System
A housing rental recommendation website for those who commutes daily, which can provide renting recommendations based on users’ personal references, such as basic information, safety anticipation, and transportation requirement.

To run our project locally:

(1)First, follow the README_BackEnd to run the backend server.

(2)Second, follow the README_FrontEnd to run the front end server.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure that the local host and port number of backend server is correctly added to line 25 and line 27 in app.js in FrontEnd directory. (i.e. Postname:127.0.0.1.  Port: 3000)

(3)Third, open your web browser and visit our website via the host and port number of your frontend program. (i.e. 127.0.0.1:3000)


##README_BackEnd
* This is the Readme for Fall 2018 CSE6242 Team Aha backend files

************NOTICE***************
This project does contain scraping programs
that do not respect some websites' /robots.txt
We are aware that this is not a good manner and 
we are not using and will never use those code 
other than this class project. 

***************IMPORTANT INFORMATION**************
Execute the programs on large searching range or 
large number of searches in a short period of time 
CAN AND WILL RESULT IP BANNED from some websites!
**************************************************

There are 11 python files: 
connectsql.py:				For querying the sqlite storing crime data;
flaskhelper_revised.py:		Helper functions for main flask app;
google_Distance.py: 		For getting distance between locations using Google Map API; [fill in your API key at '# fill in your API key' before running]
google_Score.py:			For getting place's rating on Google Map using Google Places API; [fill in your API key at '# fill in your API key' before running]
google_Stores.py:			For getting nearby store information using Google Places API; [fill in your API key at '# fill in your API key' before running]
price_as_feature.py:		For handling special price information format for apartments on Zillow;
project_v2.py:				Main flask app; 
scrape_zips.py:				For scraping zip codes within distance from a website; 
yelp_scrape_real_time.py 	For scraping real time yelp data;
zillow_scrape_real_time.py 	For scraping real time zillow data;
crime_data_cleaning.py 		For cleaning the crime dataset; 

There is also a folder 'crime_data' containing sqlite dataset storing crime data, original dataset and python file for cleaning the dataset. 

There is also a file 'test.json' containing a example/testing json file returned by backend. 

Main scraping python files have their own testing code for testing/debugging (IP banned issue or other cases). To get specific run instruction, execute:

	$ python yelp_scrape_real_time.py -help
	$ python zillow_scrape_real_time.py -help
	$ python price_as_feature.py -help

To run the main flask app 'project_v2.py' on server for public IP address visiting, please uncomment the line 215 and comment line 216. 
List for flask reroutings: 
'/test':			return the testing test.json file; 
'/':				return index.html for server debugging purpose only (note that the index.html file is not included, it can be any file ONLY for debugging purpose);
'/apartmentprice'	return formatted prices for apartments on zillow;
'/filters'			return list of found apartments satisfy the given filters; 
					[example: /filters?address='address'&type=h&beds=1&baths=1&pets=1&parking=1&laundry=1&price=500-1000&rate=3.5&review_count=10&places=xxx,yyy,zzz&travelling=driving&time_limit=20]

The backend files should be in below folder structure for successful running without modifying the code:

	/
	|__ connectsql.py
	|__ flaskhelper_revised.py
	|__ google_Distance.py
	|__ google_Score.py
	|__ price_as_feature.py
	|__ project_v2.py
	|__ scrape_zips.py
	|__ test.json
	|__ yelp_scrape_real_time.py
	|__ zillow_scrape_real_time.py
	|__ crime_data/
		|__ crime.db
		|__ crime_data_cleaning.py
		|__ crime_data.csv.zip
		|__ COBRA-2009-2017.csv.zip
		|__ cobra-2018.csv.zip


Before execute the backend, ensure you have installed following library in Python3: Flask, unicodecsv, requests, lxml, numpy

To execute the project's backend, first fill in your Google API key in line 5 of file google_Distance.py. Then execute: 
	
	$ sudo python project_v2.py
